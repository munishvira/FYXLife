## Assumptions & Shortcuts

- The risk-o-meter uses static data for demonstration.
- Goal swapping is implemented simply; no backend or AI logic.
- UI is designed for clarity and motivation, not pixel-perfect polish.
- Phone number is collected but not validated.
- No authentication or remote sync.

## Scaling Notes (v0 â†’ v1)

- **AI Suggestions:**  
  To integrate basic AI suggestions (e.g., swapping a meal/workout), I would:
  - Add a backend API endpoint that receives user profile and current goals.
  - The API would use a simple rules engine or ML model to suggest swaps based on user preferences, activity level, and health risks.
  - The frontend would fetch and display suggestions, allowing users to accept or reject them.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Add remote sync and authentication.
  - Expand risk-o-meter with real health data and trends.
  - AI-driven suggestions for goals, meals, and workouts based on user data and preferences.
  - Enhance UI with more animations and feedback.
  - Integrate push notifications for reminders and streaks.
  - Social sharing of progress and achievements.
  - Curated articles, videos, and recipes related to health and wellness.
  - Detailed charts and graphs to visualize progress over time.
